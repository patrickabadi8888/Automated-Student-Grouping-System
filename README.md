# Automated Student Grouping System

## Project Overview
The **Automated Student Grouping System** is a Python-based application designed to automate the assignment of students into balanced groups. The system ensures fairness by considering multiple criteria, reducing manual effort, and providing visual insights into group distribution.

This project was developed as part of a team project at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), with the aim of applying data analysis, algorithm design, and visualization techniques to solve real-world student management challenges.

## Features
- Automatically distributes **5,000 students** into balanced groups.
- Uses **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** for core functionality.
- Implements **data visualization** with **Matplotlib** to evaluate group balance.
- Incorporates **Scrum methodology** for project management and iterative development.
- Supports configurable criteria for group assignments.
